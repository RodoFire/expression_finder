## Expression finder.
Have you ever been in a game where you were given a list of numbers and had to find a way to reach a target value using certain operations? Did you struggle but still wanted to know the solution? Expression Finder is here to help!

It is a program that allows you to find an expression based on operations and number to get a wanted output


### Example:
    Enter the values to be used:
    1 2 3 4
    
    Enter the wanted result:
    10
    
    Enter the wanted operations:
    + - * /
    
    Print similar results? (0: no, or enter percentage tolerance, e.g. 5 for Â±5%)
    15
    
    Stop after finding one result: (y/n)
    n
    
    finding started,
    - numbers used: [ 1 2 3 4],
      - operators used: [ + - * /],
      - expected result: 10
      - round: 5
      - allResult: 1
    
    +----------------------------------------------------|
    - Found value: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  |
    +----------------------------------------------------|
    +----------------------------------------------------|
    - Found value: 4 * 3 - 2 = 10  |
    +----------------------------------------------------|
        | Close value: 2 * 4 + 3 = 11 (10%)
